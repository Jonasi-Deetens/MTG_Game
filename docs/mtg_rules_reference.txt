# 2. Actions, Abilities, and Keywords (A-Z)

## Activated Ability
- **Definition:** An ability that can be activated by paying a cost (written as "[Cost]: [Effect]").
- **Rules:** Can be activated any time you could cast an instant, unless otherwise stated. Goes on the stack and can be responded to.
- **Example:** "{T}: Add {G}." or "{1}{U}: Scry 1."

## Attack
- **Definition:** Declaring a creature as an attacker during the declare attackers step.
- **Rules:** Only untapped creatures that have been under your control since the beginning of your turn (unless they have haste) can attack. You choose which player or planeswalker to attack.
- **Example:** "Attack with two 2/2 creatures at your opponent."

## Block
- **Definition:** Declaring a creature as a blocker during the declare blockers step.
- **Rules:** Only untapped creatures can block. Each blocker can block one attacking creature unless it has abilities like "can block an additional creature."
- **Example:** "Block a 3/3 attacker with a 1/4 defender."

## Cast
- **Definition:** To play a spell from your hand (or other zone if allowed) by paying its mana cost and any additional costs.
- **Rules:** Casting a spell puts it on the stack. Players may respond before it resolves. Some spells have timing restrictions (e.g., sorceries).
- **Example:** "Cast Lightning Bolt targeting a creature."

## Counter (as a verb)
- **Definition:** To counter a spell or ability is to remove it from the stack; it does not resolve and goes to the graveyard.
- **Rules:** Only spells and abilities on the stack can be countered. Some spells are uncounterable (e.g., "This spell can't be countered.").
- **Example:** "Counter target spell with Counterspell."

## Counter (as a noun)
- **Definition:** A marker placed on a permanent or player, often to track power/toughness, abilities, or other effects.
- **Rules:** Common counters include +1/+1, -1/-1, loyalty, charge, and time counters. Counters persist until removed or the permanent leaves the battlefield.
- **Example:** "Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature."

## Control
- **Definition:** To control a permanent is to have authority over it; you decide how it is used.
- **Rules:** Control can change due to spells or abilities. "Controller" is not always the owner.
- **Example:** "Gain control of target creature until end of turn."

## Copy
- **Definition:** To create a copy of a spell, permanent, or ability.
- **Rules:** Copies inherit all characteristics of the original unless modified. Copies of spells are put on the stack; copies of permanents enter the battlefield.
- **Example:** "Create a token that's a copy of target creature."

## Crew
- **Definition:** A keyword on Vehicles. Tap any number of creatures you control with total power equal to or greater than the crew number to turn the Vehicle into an artifact creature until end of turn.

## Cycling
- **Definition:** A keyword ability that allows you to pay a cost and discard the card to draw a card.

- **Example:** "{2}: Discard this card: Draw a card."

## Convoke
- **Definition:** A keyword that lets you tap creatures to help pay for a spell. Each tapped creature pays for {1} or one mana of its color.
- **Rules:** Tapping a creature for convoke does not cause summoning sickness. Convoke can be used for colored or colorless mana.
- **Example:** "Convoke (Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for {1} or one mana of that creature's color.)"

## Cascade
- **Definition:** When you cast a spell with cascade, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card with lesser mana value. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
- **Rules:** The cascaded spell is cast, not put directly onto the stack, so it can be countered. Cascade triggers only when the spell is cast, not copied.
- **Example:** "Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card with lesser mana value. You may cast it without paying its mana cost.)"

## Deathtouch
- **Definition:** Any amount of damage this creature deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.

## Defender

- **Rules:** Defender creatures can still block normally. Some effects can override defender.
- **Example:** "Defender (This creature can't attack.)"

## Destroy
- **Definition:** To destroy a permanent is to put it into its owner's graveyard.

## Double Strike
- **Definition:** This creature deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.

## Evoke
- **Definition:** An alternative cost that allows you to cast a creature for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.
- **Rules:** Evoke is an alternative cost, not an additional cost. The creature enters the battlefield and is then sacrificed.
- **Example:** "Evoke {1}{G} (You may cast this spell for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.)"

## Exile

- **Rules:** Exiled cards are removed from the game and typically can't be retrieved unless the effect that exiled them allows it.
- **Example:** "Exile target creature."

## First Strike
- **Definition:** This creature deals combat damage before creatures without first strike.
- **Rules:** First strike creatures deal damage in the first-strike damage step. If they survive, they deal damage again in the regular combat damage step.

## Infect
- **Definition:** This creature deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters and to players in the form of poison counters.
